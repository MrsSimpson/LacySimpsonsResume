		<h3>About</h3>
		<p> Hi! I'm Lacy, a student at the University of Southern Mississippi working on my degree in 
			Computer Science with a minor in mathematics. I'm married to the love of my life Cody, 
			and we currently reside in D'Iberville, Mississippi.<br> 
				When I'm not buried in books or studying for the next exam, I enjoy learning about new technologies,
			reading fiction, playing video games with my husband, and spending time with our family.<br> 
				I have a genuine passion for writing code, and I'm confident that I have found my calling. 
			I enjoy working on development projects just for fun, but now that I am in my final year of school, I 
			am preparing to put my skills to use and find a career that I am passionate about.
