        <p> Eagle Social <br>
            A brief background to the development of Eagle Social. <br>
            During the Spring Semester of 2017 while taking Object Oriented Programming, I had the privilidge of working with a group of other like minded students that had the desire learn and experiment with iOS application development. As a group, we wanted experience learning Swift and creating an application for our class project. We chose to create a social media application, Eagle Social, for students and faculity that could be used by the University. Although the project was never presented to the school, we did complete the assignment, and we ended up with a fully functional iOS socail media application written in Swift using Google's Firebase as our non relational database. The project was a lot of fun to work on and also very challenging at times, but I learned quite a bit over the course of 5 months. I learned how to of take an idea and create something tangable and real. I also gained invaluable experince working as a team on my first group development project. The project brought new challenges, such as learning GitHub, learning a new language, learning how to work with a non relational data base, and completing deliverables as if our project were in a real workforce development project.
